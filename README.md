**Accursed: Pumpkins!**

*What is Accursed: Pumpkins!?*
Accursed: Pumpkins! is a mod that provides the users the ability to add custom pumpkin designs to a folder, and dynamically create a resource pack for it. It also
comes with built-in support for pumpkins to have multiple designs.

*Will this screw up my modpack's crafting recipes?*
The mod implements it's own custom-designed pumpkin, separate from the vanilla one, obtained by using a hoe on any vanilla pumpkin. This allows any recipes that use vanilla
jack'o'lanterns, carved pumpkins, or regular pumpkins to work fine even with this mod installed.
